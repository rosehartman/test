The Fish Restoration Program Monitoring Team is tasked with monitoring fish and food web resources in restored tidal wetland sites. These restored sites are located in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta and Suisun Marsh pursuant to requirements in the 2008/2009 Biological Opinions for state and federal water project operations. Data on fish and invertebrate abundance on or near these sites was collected as baseline monitoring data and to determine the most efficient methods for monitoring wetlands. Understanding how invertebrate and fish communities change pre- to post-restoration is essential to evaluating the benefits of tidal wetlands to native fish species. Invertebrate data was collected using sweep nets, benthic cores, neuston nets, and zooplankton trawls. Fish data was collected using a lampara net and beach seine. For each method, the team recorded the catch of fish or invertebrates, length of organisms, and a suite of environmental information, including: dissolved oxygen, temperature, pH, specific conductance, and turbidity.
